# Tank

This is a tankgame AI based on [botzone](botzone.org) which is the Final Project of **Practice of Programming in C&C++**.

In this project, a bot named **Vulture** is created to win as many games as possible. We considered a large number of boundary conditions to make it get a better performance.

The bot is still used today to help the freshman of PKU choosing this course to optimize their bot and have a better score.
